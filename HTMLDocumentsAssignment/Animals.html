        Owning a pet has multiple perks â€“ it gives you a sense of companionship,
        makes you more responsible, and provides emotional support. However,
        before you decide to own a pet, you should weigh the pros and cons and
        make an informed decision as pet ownership comes with a lot of
        responsibilities and is a lifelong commitment.
