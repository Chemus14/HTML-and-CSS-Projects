      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">
        Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or
        inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and
        external stimuli.[58] As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds
        inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a
        result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the
        ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other
        species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[13] Behavioral
        scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities
        in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest
        canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great
        apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.[59]
