        <h2>Bristol</h2>
        <p>
          Bristol (/ˈbrɪstəl/ (listen)) is a city, ceremonial county and unitary
          authority in England.[9] Situated on the River Avon, it is bordered by
          the ceremonial counties of Gloucestershire to the north and Somerset
          to the south. Bristol is the most populous city in South West
          England.[10] The wider Bristol Built-up Area is the eleventh most
          populous urban area in the United Kingdom.[7]

          Archaeological finds, including flint tools believed to be between
          300,000 and 126,000 years old made with the Levallois technique,
          indicate the presence of Neanderthals in the Shirehampton and St Annes
          areas of Bristol during the Middle Palaeolithic.[19] Iron Age hill
          forts near the city are at Leigh Woods and Clifton Down, on the side
          of the Avon Gorge, and on Kings Weston Hill near Henbury.[20] A Roman
          settlement, Abona,[21] existed at what is now Sea Mills (connected to
          Bath by a Roman road); another was at the present-day Inns Court.
          Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also
          scattered throughout the area.[22]
